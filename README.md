## Build Setup

```bash
# run database service container
$ docker-compose up -d
# or with hardware profiling
$ docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml --service-name


# move into workfolder
$ cd ./api

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# run migrations and seeding in interactive mode
$ node ace migration:run
$ node ace db:seed -i


# serve with hot reload at localhost:3333
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

### Notes:
**Important**: While running seeders in interactive mode is important to note that the **CreateActions** should be the **LAST** one seeded to avoid model relationship errors during the process.

Also remember to update your local **```.env```** in the ```api``` folder
